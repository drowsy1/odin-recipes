    <p>My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough! 
    If you have children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat 
    (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's also fabulous with a Christmas ham.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Macaroni</strong>: This homemade mac and cheese starts with a box of uncooked macaroni noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> and <strong>Flour</strong>: You'll need butter and flour to make a roux for the cheese sauce. You'll also need two tablespoons of butter for the topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Use whole milk for the richest flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: This baked mac and cheese recipe calls for Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong> Salt and pepper goes into the sauce, while paprika is sprinkled over the topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread crumbs</strong>: Use store-bought dried bread crumbs or make your own at home. </li>
    </ul>
